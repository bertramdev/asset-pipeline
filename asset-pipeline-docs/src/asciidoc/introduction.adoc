== Introduction

The asset-pipeline provides first class static and 'not so static' asset management for the JVM including many native framework integrations. It is highly extensible and provides processing of dynamic languages like LESS, SASS, Coffee, Typescript, and more. This goes beyond simple asset packaging and processing (making tools like grunt or webpack unnecessary for building high quality single page apps on the JVM), but also takes it a step further by providing features for optimally serving assets from your application as well.

This guide documents configuration and usage examples of the asset-pipeline plugin.
