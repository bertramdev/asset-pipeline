The Grails Asset-Pipeline is a plugin used for managing and processing static assets in [Grails|http://grails.org] applications. Asset-Pipeline functions include processing and minification of both CSS and JavaScript files. It is also capable of being extended to compile custom static assets, such as CoffeeScript or LESS.

This guide documents the configuration needed to setup the plugin and provides sample code on how to use it.

h3. Relation to Resources Plugin

Asset-Pipeline is intended to replace the de facto Grails equivalent [resources-plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/resources] with a more efficient, developer friendly architecture (similar to [Rails Asset Pipeline|http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html]). The Asset-Pipeline leverages the latest in minification (UglifyJS) to reduce your asset sizes as much as possible. A few differences between the resources plugin and asset-pipeline include:

* On the fly processing - No more waiting for your assets to reload after making a change
* Compiled assets on war create - No more hanging up application boot times while processing files. @grails war@
* Reduced Dependence - The plugin has compression, minification, and cache-digests built in.
* Easy Debugging - Makes for easy debugging by keeping files seperate in development mode.
* Simpler manifests and taglibs - Read on for more information.
